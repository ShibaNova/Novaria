~~ NEED TO FIX ~~

~~FLEET~~
// can build and claim ships without being at the planet (needs a map check)
// pass player through 'getminingcapacity'
// in buildships, change to Treasury.pay instead of deposit
- add modifier for endBattle
- add battle code

~~MAP~~
// allocate needs to have if statement to run if there is 0 nova
// mine doesn't collect mineral? pass player through 'getminingcapacity'
// set player location breaks getPlayersAtLocation (don't care?)
// travel may not work? numFleetAtLocation-1 
// add a mine cooldown?
// if amount to mine is 0 (fleetmineral at max capacity), should mining fail? Probably
// refine doesn't change previous balance
- add explore function
